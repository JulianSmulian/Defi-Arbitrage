# Uni-Sushi-Kyber-Pancake-Liquidity
Not the optimum path to arbitrage but good learning tools to help understand how liquidity effects different prices on defi-exchanges 
Web3, nodejs, javascript, infura tools to measure liquidity between Uniswap and Sushiswap. Binance Chain(Pancake,Apeswap,Julswap,Bakeryswap) price comparison also.
1) Install nodejs from command line FILE LOCATION THEN --- install npm
2) Create dot env file (.env) from command line --- https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv
3) Create an Infura account --- https://infura.io/

.env file should look like this 

RPC_URL="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/PROJECT_ID" 

PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR METAMASK ACCOUNT PRIVATE KEY REMOVE 0x from string"

ACCOUNT="YOUR METAMASK ETH/BINANCE ACCOUNT ADDRESS REMOVE 0x from string"

This project can be greatly improved. I orginally wrote the code for fun to learn how arbitrage works. 
I have from time to time been able to sucessfully do arbitrage between exchanges. 
I have also had many failures and have tweaked to code multiple times to improve the chances of success.

PLEASE US the sushiswap_uniswap_ropsten.js BEFORE using real money on ETH network. 
I am not responsible for any losses from any transaction you make. 

You can use these for arbitrage BUT there are faster and more accurate ways to find arbitrage between exchanges. I will leave that up to you to discover.
Here are a couple of links to devs that I learned a lot from. Feel free to ask me a question.

Extra:
A couple of helpful principles to help you understand how price is determined with Uniswap, Pancake pairs etc
EthTokens is BinanceCoin on Binance Network

(#EthTokens /#Tokens) X EthPrice = Token Price 

#EthTokens / #Tokens = Token per Eth

If you catch the market at the right time and find some great arbs send a few wei my way.
